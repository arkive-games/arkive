"""Pet/creature ("Pet" category) markers, derived purely from the raw export.

Pets are Vehicle Creatures. Each pet's source creature is an NPC that drops the
pet's "Vehicle Soul" item; that NPC's world spawns are where you obtain the pet.
This module joins VehicleList -> Item -> NpcLoot to map source NpcId -> pet
(CreatureType subtype + localized name), then clusters the NPC's spawn positions
per pet so the map isn't flooded with one marker per spawn point.

All functions are pure (no file IO); callers pass in already-loaded tables, a
WorldMapTransform, and an L10N resolver.
